 * This method returns the elevation in meters at a given longitude and latitude
 * within the WGS84 coordinate system. By default the elevation is measured with
 * respect to the Earth's mean sea level. It takes into account the local
 * variations in gravity and provides a consistent vertical reference.
 *
 * If the relativeTo query parameter is set to `ellipsoid`, the elevation will be
 * measured with respect to the ellipsoid. This is a mathematical model that
 * approximates the shape of the Earth. It does not consider local variations
 * in gravity and is commonly used in GPS positioning.
